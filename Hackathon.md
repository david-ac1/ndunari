🏆 Gemini 3 Global Hackathon: Submission & Alignment Guide
1. Hackathon Overview
Name: Google DeepMind - Vibe Code with Gemini 3

Timeline: December 17, 2025 – February 10, 2026

Core Challenge: Build a brand-new application that leverages the Gemini 3 model family (Pro & Flash) to solve a daily frustration or global challenge.

Primary Theme: "Vibe Coding"—using natural language to steer AI agents in building functional, sophisticated software.

2. Technical Requirements (The "Winner's Codebase")
To score in the top tier, the codebase must explicitly implement these Gemini 3 features:

A. Multimodal Native Reasoning
Alignment: Use media_resolution="high" for the Forensic Eye vision tasks.

Implementation: The app must process real-time video/image frames to detect microscopic packaging errors (impossible with legacy models).

B. Tiered Agent Thinking (Thinking Levels)
Flash (Minimal/Low): Use for fast, low-latency UI interactions and initial drug scans.

Pro (High/Default): Use for deep clinical stewardship reasoning (WHO AWaRe classification).

Requirement: Projects must demonstrate the "AI Thinking" process in the UI to build user trust.

C. Protocol Compliance: Thought Signatures
Critical Rule: Every multi-turn conversation or tool-call sequence MUST circulate thought_signature strings.

Anti-Failure: Antigravity must ensure the state manager saves the signature from the model response and re-injects it into the next turn to avoid 400 Errors.

3. Submission Artifacts
Kaggle Writeup: A public project report (Max 250 words).

Video Demo: A 2-minute maximum video telling a story of impact. (Note: Only the first 2 minutes are reviewed).

Public App Link: Must be a functional Public AI Studio App or a deployed Public PWA/Web Link.

Open Source: Code repositories must be public on GitHub.

4. Judging Criteria (Weighted Scoring)
Impact (40%): Does Ndunari solve a real-world problem? (Focus: AMR & Fake Drugs).

Technical Depth & Execution (30%): Is the technology real and well-engineered? (Focus: Live NAFDAC API & Agentic Handshakes).

Creativity (20%): Does it use Gemini 3 in ways previously impossible? (Focus: Forensic package analysis).

Presentation Quality (10%): Is the story compelling and the video viral-ready?
